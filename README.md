**INTRODUCTION**
My work shows the process involved in analyzing workforce time utilization trends across various dimensions, including job roles, job categories, work locations, gender, age brackets, and geographical regions, to identify key insights into employee productivity. The analysis reveals that a total of 198,073 hours were worked from January 1st to 7th, 2014, with the highest hours recorded on January 1st and the IT sector leading in total hours worked (29,853 hours). Project Managers (29,463 hours) and remote workers (67,610 hours) contributed the most, while male employees (50,800 hours) led in workforce engagement. The Oceania region (34,197 hours) had the highest contribution, and the age group of 45–53 years showed the highest work hours. The report also highlights fluctuations in daily work hours, with peaks and dips across the week. By leveraging this data, organizations can improve efficiency, optimize work conditions, and understand workforce dynamics for better decision-making and performance evaluation.

**DATA CLEANING**

The dataset was gotten from Kaggle, and several strategies were applied to ensure data consistency and accuracy:

Duplicate Removal: Duplicate rows were identified and deleted to prevent inconsistent results.
Text to Columns: Combined datThese steps helped transform the raw dataset into a clean, structured foundation for insightful analysis.a points in a single column were split using the Text to Columns function, ensuring each value was properly categorized.
Date Formatting: Inconsistent date entries were corrected, with all dates standardized to a uniform date format for accurate time-based analysis.
Standard Table Conversion: The dataset was transformed into a structured Excel table to enable easier management, automation, and dynamic analysis.

**PRE-ANALYSIS**

Before building the charts, I conducted a pre-analysis to better understand the dataset and guide my storytelling process. This involved breaking down the data into meaningful components:

Project Split: I categorized the data points into dependent and independent variables, helping me understand the relationships within the dataset and what types of insights could be extracted.
Potential Analysis & Questions: From the grouped variables, I generated key questions that the dataset could answer. This step highlighted the potential insights hidden within the data, even before visualizing it.
Preliminary Insights: By thinking through the questions and data points, I uncovered early insights, which made it easier to shape the narrative and focus the analysis on valuable outcomes.
Storytelling: Once I had a clear understanding of the dataset, I could tell a story from it. By putting together the relationships between the datapoints and the insights uncovered.
Industry & Stakeholders: This process helped me identify the relevant industry, the stakeholders who would benefit from the analysis, and what success would look like for the organization based on the findings.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8fd0c89-5c0d-4450-a467-6888b5d368c0)

Strengthen Remote Work Policies: Since remote employees contribute the most hours, companies should enhance remote work structures and provide better support to maintain productivity.

Ensure Fair Workload Distribution by Gender: With males logging the highest work hours, a review should be conducted to promote equitable task allocation and prevent burnout.

Evaluate Regional Work Patterns: As Oceania leads in work hours and North America lags, organizations should assess regional engagement factors and offer targeted support.

Optimize Project Manager Workload: Due to their demanding schedules, organizations should explore delegation or automation for Project Managers to prevent exhaustion.

Balance Workload in High-Demand Industries: Given the high work hours in IT, companies should ensure adequate staffing, mental health support, and workload management in this sector.

Develop Succession Plans for Mid-Career Employees: Since professionals aged 45 and 53 work the most hours, businesses should implement retention strategies and succession planning for younger employees.

Distribute Work Hours Evenly Across the Week: With January 1st recording the highest work hours, organizations should analyze workload trends to ensure balanced productivity throughout the week

Assess Low Work Hours in Specific Roles: Since Data Scientists recorded the least work hours, companies should investigate whether this is due to efficiency, lower demand, or opportunities for additional task allocation.
